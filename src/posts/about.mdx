Hello! I’m Luke, and this is my personal website — a space where I share the projects, ideas, and anything else that sparks my curiosity. I’m currently an undergraduate studying Mathematics at [Warwick University](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/), with a strong interest in Computer Science. I’m especially drawn to anything Data Science, Machine Learning, and Competitive Programming (algorithms).

I enjoy problem-solving and building things. I’ve built projects with Python, R, and TypeScript. You can explore some of these in the <Link to="/projects">projects</Link> section of this website or by checking out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Turnyanskiy).

I also write about some of my experiences, learning and experiments in my <Link to="/blog">blog</Link>.
