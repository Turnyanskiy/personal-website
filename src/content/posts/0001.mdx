# Blog Post in Progress

This post is currently a work in progress. I’ve been busy with my work at InstaDeep and haven’t finished writing it yet. 

The post will explore:
- The mathematics of Fourier and Hartley transformations
- The Fourier Slice Theorem
- Applications of these concepts in structural biology

Once complete, it will provide a deeper understanding of these transformations mathematically and how they are used in structural biology.
